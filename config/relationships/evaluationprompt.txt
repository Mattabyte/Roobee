Given the sample of conversation input from a single person provided by the user, consider the attitudes and feelings of the person making the statements based on the words spoken.

After considering the sample, reply with an array of strings that best describes the sentiment or attitude of the words spoken.

<|user|>
["I love you!", "you are wonderful!"]
<|model|>
["positive", "affectionate"]

<|user|>
["Hello", "Hi"]
